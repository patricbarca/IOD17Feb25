Agentic RAG adds reasoning and multi-step decision-making to this, allowing the model to refine its responses intelligently, like an agent. Additional tools (for this demo, web search using Serper) may be executed before coming up with a final answer.\n","\n","[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) is an open-source framework used to develop applications based on large language models. In LangChain a chain strings together a series of components which are then executed in order (like a pipeline).\n","\n","Serper is a Google Search API that allows real-time web searches using data from Google. Itâ€™s often used in AI agent systems, chatbots, and RAG pipelines for real-time access to information from the web.\n","\n","Components of the system:\n","* a pdf loader that takes in the text of the pdf document\n","  \n","* a simple vector store which stores a vector representation of chunks of the document - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library that enables this\n","    \n","* A retriever to fetch relevant documents based on a user query\n","\n","* A language model (Gemini) to process the query\n","\n","* Vector search and Web search tools to be used by the agent.\n","

In this article, I'll explain the basic differences between coding and programming and how they work collaboratively to develop apps and sites. The primary difference between coding vs. programming is the level of responsibility. Both require strong programming skills. Programming is creating a plot, an outline, the story and structure of the book, and coding is writing the parts that will make up the book. While coding means writing codes from one language to another, programming means programming a machine with a given set of instructions to run. Programming is creating the logic, coding is translating that logic into code. Many students come into class able to code, but almost none come ...
